/*
JS Todos Exercise
Part 1
For this assignment you will be combining your knowledge of DOM access and events to build a todo app!

As a user, you should be able to:

Add a new todo (by submitting a form)
Mark a todo as completed (cross out the text of the todo)
Remove a todo
Part 2
Now that you have a functioning todo app, save your todos in localStorage! Make sure that when the page refreshes, the todos on the page remain there.
