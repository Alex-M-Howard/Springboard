Goals
Explain what CSS is
Write basic CSS rules
Style some content (even if doesn’t look pretty)
Getting started
Our web pages don’t look all that great…
If we want to change the appearance of our webpages, it’s time to learn CSS!
If HTML is the structure of the page and content,

CSS is the style of that content.

HTML - the nouns CSS - the adjectives

Introducing CSS!
Cascading
Style
Sheets
Let’s ignore the “cascading” part for now and just focus on “style sheets”
What Can You Do With Css?
fonts
colors
web / print / mobile layout
animations
so much more!
Where do we write our CSS?
Including CSS
We can do this three ways!

In our HTML using a <style> element
External stylesheet using a <link> element
(Inline) - DON’T DO THIS!
We will be using an external stylesheet as it is far more common

Linking to a stylesheet
<link rel="stylesheet" href="homepage.css">
Make sure to put this inside of the <head> element
This assumes that we have a file in the same folder called homepage.css
CSS Syntax
What does it look like?
Here is the idea:

select-some-html {
  property: value;
}
Here is an example:

body {
  background-color: purple;
}
Let’s examine that in detail
body {
  background-color: purple;
}
Selector - what we would like to style
Declaration - Everything in the curly braces
Property - left of the colon
Value - right of the colon followed by a semicolon
We tell css what we want to select, and how we want it to be styled

Our first style
Starting with the basics
There are tons and tons of different properties in css, let’s start with a simple one - color

To make all paragraphs purple:

p {
  color: purple;
}
Including multiple properties
In CSS we place each property and value on one line, but we can include multiple rules in one declaration.

p {
  color: purple;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-size: 16px;
}
Color in CSS
Lots of options!

Named colors (red, green, blue, papayawhip)
RGB - rgb(121, 12, 41)
RBGA - rgba(121, 12, 41, .4)
Hex - #00bfff
HSL - hsl(195, 100%, 50%)
Text Properties
font-size - how big should the font be?
font-family - what type of font?
text-align - left? center?
line-height - how much space between lines?
font sizes
So far we’ve seen values for colors, but how do we measure font-size?

Many ways!

px (pixels)
% (percentages)
And many more!
Don’t panic!
Don’t get overwhelmed by the hundreds of CSS properties
You do not need to spend much of your time studying or memorizing the vast majority of them.
Google or turn to MDN whenever you’re not sure how to accomplish something in CSS
“add a border to the bottom of an element”
Recap
CSS is used to style HTML elements and layout web pages
CSS syntax consists of selectors, declarations, properties and values
CSS can also be used for animations, responsive design and much more!
