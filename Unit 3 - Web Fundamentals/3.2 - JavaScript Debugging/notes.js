//Different errors
/*
syntax error - something is typed incorrectly
reference error - variable is being referenced that doesn't exist, or isn't in same scope
type error- Trying to do something with a variable that is not possible of a certain type. String method on an int for example
*/


//Anatomy of an error message
/*

Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected app.js:6 token ';'

You can see the type of error, the file name, line number, and reason
*/

//Use console.log to help you debug when you get a bug that doesn't throw an error
