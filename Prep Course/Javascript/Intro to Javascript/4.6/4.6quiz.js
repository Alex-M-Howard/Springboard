let i = 0;
while (i <= 10) {
	console.log(i);
	i++;
}

//Even numbers to 20
//Using a for loop console.log all the even numbers from 0 to 20
for (let i = 0; i <= 20; i += 2) {
	console.log(i);
}

//Odd numbers to 20
//Using a while loop console.log all the odd numbers from 0 to 20
let j = 1;
while (j <= 20) {
	console.log(j);
	j += 2;
}

//Back to zero
//Using a for loop console.log all the numbers from 10 to 0.
for (let i = 10; i >= 0; i--) {
	console.log(i);
