let variable  // Let has block scope   - has to be initialized before code ran - can't be globally scoped
var variable2 // Var has function scope  - can be accessed before code is run - can be globally scoped


const variable3 = 0 // Constant that won't change. Block scope. use for new array, object, function, regExp - 

//You can't reassign a constant array, but you can change the elements
const cars = ["Saab", "volvo", "BMW"] //vs. cars = ["ford", "toyota", "buick"]
