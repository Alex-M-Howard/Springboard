Goals
Explain what the Box Model is
Compare and contrast border, margin, padding and outline
Easily calculate true width and height with box-sizing
Box Model

Margin is outside of border (“space between”)
Padding is inside of border (“space inside”)
Direction Shorthands
margin, padding, and border all support four different ways to set their value:

one number for top, right, bottom, and left
e.g. margin: 10px;
two numbers, for top & bottom, right & left
e.g. margin: 10px 20px;
three numbers, for top, right & left, bottom
e.g. margin: 10px 20px 30px;
four numbers, for top, right, bottom, left
e.g. margin: 10px 20px 30px 40px;
Box Sizing
div {
  box-sizing: content-box;
  width: 100px;
  padding: 1em;
  border: solid 5px black;
}
content-box is the default
Content area is 100px
Don’t know how wide element is
 
div {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  width: 100px;
  padding: 1em;
  border: solid 5px black;
}
Element width is 100px
Don’t know width of content area
Often, easier to work with
Outline
Outlines are like borders …

but are outside of borders
but never take up space
div:hover {
  outline: solid 5px red;
  outline-offset: 5px;
}
Often most used for hover effects, so things don’t “move”
