JavaScript Statement Identifiers
JavaScript statements often start with a statement identifier to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.

Statement identifiers are reserved words and cannot be used as variable names (or any other things).

The following table lists all JavaScript statement identifiers:

debugger	Stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls (if available) the debugging function
do ... while	Executes a block of statements and repeats the block while a condition is true
for	Loops through a block of code a number of times
for ... in	Loops through the properties of an object
for ... of	Loops through the values of an iterable object
